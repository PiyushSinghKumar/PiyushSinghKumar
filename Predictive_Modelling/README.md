# Predictive Modelling

This repository contains various machine learning projects focusing on predictive modeling techniques. The projects aim to predict outcomes using different algorithms and approaches such as Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, LDA, and more. Each notebook covers data exploration, preprocessing, model building, evaluation, and key insights.

## ðŸ“‚ Projects

### 1. [Linear Regression](Linear_Regression.ipynb)
- **Objective**: Predict a continuous target variable using linear regression.
- **Techniques Used**:
  - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
  - Data Preprocessing (Handling missing values, encoding)
  - Model Building (Linear Regression)
  - Model Evaluation (R-Squared, Mean Absolute Error)
- **Dataset**: [Dataset details here]

### 2. [Logistic Regression and LDA](Logistic_Regression_and_LDA.ipynb)
- **Objective**: Predict categorical outcomes (e.g., binary classification) using Logistic Regression and Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA).
- **Techniques Used**:
  - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
  - Data Preprocessing (Scaling, Encoding)
  - Model Building (Logistic Regression, LDA)
  - Model Evaluation (Accuracy, Confusion Matrix, ROC-AUC)
- **Dataset**: [Dataset details here]

## ðŸ”§ Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Scikit-Learn
- Matplotlib / Seaborn (for data visualization)
- Jupyter Notebooks

## ðŸ“ˆ Results & Insights
- Each project includes an analysis of the model's performance and key insights. For example:
  - Linear Regression: Evaluating continuous predictions with error metrics.
  - Logistic Regression & LDA: Analyzing classification accuracy and improving model performance with regularization or other techniques.
